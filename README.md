# The Meta-Representation Hypothesis
Meta-representation is a higher-order representation, akin to the human ability to abstract concepts.

# Introduction
![abstraction](results/abstraction.jpg)

_Pablo Picassoâ€™s The Bull. By focusing on and exaggerating specific details, rather than trying to capture every detail realistically, artists can convey the core meaning or essence of the subject more powerfully._

# Motivation
![motivation](results/motivation.png)

_We propose a hypothesis that deep mutual learning (DML) technique can help agents learn meta-representations of high-dimensional observations, thus improving generalization performance._
